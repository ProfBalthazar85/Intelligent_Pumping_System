# PID-Controlled Variable Speed Constant Pressure Centrifugal Pumping System 
This repo holds firmware (in MCS51 assembly) for the Atmel AT89C55 microcontroller. The microcontroller is at the center of an embedded controller that controls a variable speed drive (VFD) and four centrifusal pumps to generate constant fluid pressure and/or change water flow based on input hydrographs.


## History
In an old project (dated 2003 - 2005), I developed an pressure-programmable pumping system comprised of a high-voltage control panel, electronic control board, variable frequency drive (VFD), and three centrifugal pumps. Relying on PID (Proportional- Integral-Derivative) control, the system was able to maintain constant fluid pressure (independent of the flow rate) at the output. I have posted a video about this system on YouTube ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ABVqOo-8IU)).
